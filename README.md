# File Sharing Project
Hi! Thank you for taking the time to check out this repo.
This project aims to create a Google Dropbox-like experience (or iCloud if you're an Apple user, like me), but better.

## Core Points
This project (I'll eventually get a better name) has some core principles, that are followed at all times (but are subject to change, due to the fact that this is still under active development), such as:
- No tracking
- Easy to use
- Completely free

## How to use
This project is not very featured right now...
But it is under active development. As of now, there is no styling, no JS, and the only thing you can do is create an account and stare at a hello message on your profile page.
### Creating an account
To create an account click on the `Create an account` link on the main page, fill out the fields (username and password), then submit the form. You will then be redirected to your (minimal) profile page. As of now, this only contains a hello message with your username, but it's something -- the first one I've done. It will be improved at time goes on, don't worry -- it shouldn't be like that for *too* long.
