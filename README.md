# File Sharing Project
Hi! Thank you for taking the time to check out this repo.
This project aims to create a Google Dropbox-like experience (or iCloud if you're an Apple user, like me), but better.
## Core Points
This project (I'll eventually get a better name) has some core principles, that are followed at all times (but are subject to change, due to the fact that this is still under active development), such as:
- No tracking
- Easy to use
- Completely free
